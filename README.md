# Objective
+ The aim of this project is to experiment with Bayesian statistics as a method of analysis.

# Points to note
+ It compares a frequentist multiple linear regression against a Bayesian linear regression.
+ Also adopts reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP) principles to ensure that other people can obtain the same outputs when running the code.
